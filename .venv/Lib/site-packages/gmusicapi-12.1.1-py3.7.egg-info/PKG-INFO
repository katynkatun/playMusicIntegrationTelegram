Description: gmusicapi: an unofficial API for Google Play Music
        ==================================================
        
        gmusicapi allows control of
        `Google Music <http://music.google.com>`__ with Python.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from gmusicapi import Mobileclient
            
            api = Mobileclient()
            # after running api.perform_oauth() once:
            api.oauth_login('<a previously-registered device id>')
            # => True
            
            library = api.get_all_songs()
            sweet_track_ids = [track['id'] for track in library
                               if track['artist'] == 'The Cat Empire']
            
            playlist_id = api.create_playlist('Rad muzak')
            api.add_songs_to_playlist(playlist_id, sweet_track_ids)
            
        **gmusicapi is not supported nor endorsed by Google.**
        
        That said, it's actively maintained, and powers a bunch of cool projects:
        
        -  alternate clients, including
           `one designed for the visually impaired <https://github.com/chrisnorman7/gmp3>`__,
           `a web-based jukebox which ships with its own server <https://github.com/chrisnorman7/jukebox>`__,
           `command line <https://github.com/christopher-dg/pmcli>`__
           `clients <https://github.com/and3rson/clay>`__,
           `a FUSE filesystem <https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/GMusicFS>`__,
           and `an Alexa skill <https://github.com/stevenleeg/geemusic>`__
        -  library management tools for
           `syncing tracks <https://github.com/thebigmunch/gmusicapi-scripts>`__,
           `syncing playlists <https://github.com/soulfx/gmusic-playlist>`__,
           and `migrating to a different account <https://github.com/brettcoburn/gmusic-migrate>`__
        -  proxies for media players, such as
           `gmusicproxy <https://github.com/gmusicproxy/gmusicproxy>`__ and
           `gmusicprocurator <https://github.com/malept/gmusicprocurator>`__,
           as well as plugins for 
           `Mopidy <https://github.com/hechtus/mopidy-gmusic>`__,
           `Squeezebox <https://github.com/squeezebox-googlemusic/squeezebox-googlemusic>`__ and
           `Tizonia <https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il>`__.
        -  enhancements like `autoplaylists / smart playlists <https://autoplaylists.simon.codes>`__
        
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        Start with `the usage docs <http://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#usage>`__, which will guide you through installation and the available apis.
        
        Once you're up and running, you can explore the rest of the docs at http://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.io.
        
        If the documentation doesn't answer your questions, or you just want to get
        in touch, either `drop by #gmusicapi on Freenode
        <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=gmusicapi>`__ or shoot me an email.

        - add an exception CallFailure. Api functions raise it if the server says their request failed
        - add suppress_failure (default False) option to Api.__init__()
        - change_playlist now returns the changed playlistId (pid)
        - change_song_metadata now returns a list of changed songIds (sids)
        - create_playlist now returns the new pid
        - delete_playlist now returns the deleted pid
        - delete_songs now returns a list of deleted sids
        - change_playlist now returns the pid of the playlist - which may differ from the one passed in
        - add_songs_to_playlist now returns a list of (sid, new playlistEntryId aka eid) tuples of added songs
        - remove_songs_from_playlist now returns a list of removed (sid, eid) pairs
        - search dictionary is now flattened, without the "results" key. see documentation for example
        
        2012.03.27
        ++++++++++
        
        - package for pip/pypi
        - add AUTHORS file
        - remove session.py; the sessions are now just api.PlaySession (Darryl Pogue)
        - protocol.Metadata_Expectations.get_expectation will return UnknownExpectation when queried for unknown keys; this should prevent future problems
        - add immutable 'subjectToCuration' and 'metajamId' fields - use unknown
        
        2012.03.16
        ++++++++++
        
        - add change_playlist for playlist modifications
        - get_playlists supports multiple playlists of the same name by returning lists of playlist ids. By default, it will return a single string (the id) for unique playlist names; see the always_id_lists parameter.
        - api.login now attempts to bump Music Manager authentication first, bypassing browser emulation. This allows for much faster authentication.
        - urls updated for the change to Google Play Music
        - remove_songs_from_playlist now takes (playlist_id, song_ids), for consistency with other playlist mutations

        - improve logging
